# Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

*This is the first project from FreeCodeCamp.org's "Algorithmic Trading Using Python - Full Course" on Youtube 

-The goal was to design a program  in pythonthat read data from the IEX Cloud Api and compiled the data in to pandas data frame
-Then the script would calculate how much of each stock to purchase in order to have an equal weight of each based on market cap
-Finally the program would output the data into an excel file

*NOTE: the IEX Cloud API did not contain information for "WLTW" and that is why the program drops it
